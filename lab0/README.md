# Lab 0 - Setup

## Docker Setup
### Windows

 Create an Ubuntu (or another linux distro if you prefer) virtual machine.  [Guide](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox)
 
 
### OSX

    brew install docker
    
If you don't have brew, [install it](https://brew.sh/).
    
    
### Linux

 Docker is available in the distribution packages of most linux distros, but may not be the bleeding edge latest.
 
 Here is a guide for installation on [Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04) 
 
 
 
### Conclusion

You should now be able to run

    which docker
    
and get back a path to the docker daemon executable


## AWS Setup

  For lab 4 and beyond, an AWS account is required.  It is expected that you will have created this and have your keys
  properly setup so that the AWS-CLI is usable.
  
  I'll add directions here if/when time permits.
